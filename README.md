# Persian W3Schools (Training Project)

This is a **Persian version of W3Schools** that I developed as a training project.  
The goal of this project is only to **practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** skills.  
It is **not a full website** and **not for production use**.

## 📌 Features
- Persian interface inspired by W3Schools  
- Header with navigation bar  
- Sidebar with HTML tutorials  
- Advertisement section  
- Footer included on all pages  
- 3–4 sample pages developed  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Browse through the sidebar tutorials and navigation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` → Main page  
- `header.html` → Header component  
- `header.css` → Header styles  
- `footer.html` → Footer component  
- `style.css` → Styles for the website  
- `script.js` → JavaScript (load header & footer dynamically)  
- `mainStyles.css` → header + body + footer styles

## 🎯 Goal
This project is **only for learning and practicing** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is **not complete**, and development is finished for now.
